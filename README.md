## About

A single-page web application built using the React framework. A Google Map is shown, with 5 locations displayed by markers. Clicking on a marker will show an infowindow, which will give more information about the location, as given by the [https://foursquare.com/](Foursquare) API.

The 5 locations are also listed in a sidebar. The information about the location can be found by clicking on that location in the list.

A textbox is provided to filter locations. Only those locations matching the text will show in the sidebar and map.

The application is usable by the keyboard and a screen reader.

## Installation and Getting Started

Clone the repository to a local project directory.

Run 'npm start' from a terminal within the project directory.

The application will run in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.
